[C]Silver bells, [F]silver bells,
[G7]it's Christmas time in the [C]city.
Ringaling, [F]hear them ring
[G7]soon it [(Adim7)]will [G7]be Christmas [C]Day.

City [C]sidewalks, busy sidewalks
[C7]dressed in [F]holiday style;
in the [G7]air there's a feeling of [C6sus4]Christ[C]mas.

Children laughing, people passing,
[C7]meeting [F]smile after smile,
and on [G7]ev'ry street corner you [C]hear:

[C]Silver bells, [F]silver bells,
[G7]it's Christmas time in the [C]city.
Ringaling, [F]hear them ring
[G7]soon it [(Adim7)]will [G7]be Christmas [C]Day.

Strings of [C]street lights, even stoplights
[C7]blink a [F]bright red and green
as the [G7]shoppers rush home with their [C6sus4]treas[C]ures.

Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch,
[C7]this is [F]Santa's big scene,
and a[G7]bove all this bustle you hear:

[G7]soon it [(Adim7)]will [G7]be Christmas [C]Day.
