[C]Frosty the snowman
Was a [F]jolly [F#dim7]happy  [C]soul,
With a [F]corncob [F#dim7]pipe and a [C]button [A]nose
And two [Dm]eyes made [G]out of [C]coal.  [G7]

[C]Frosty the snowman is a [F]fairy [F#dim7]tale, they [C]say,
He was [F]made of [F#dim7]snow
But the [C]children [A]know
How he [Dm]came to [G]life one [C]day.   [C7]

There [F]must have [F#dim7]been some [C]magic [A7]
in that [Dm]old silk [G7]hat they [C]found.
For [G]when they placed it on his [G#dim7]head
He [Am]began to [D6]dance a[G]round. [G7]O...

[C]Frosty the snowman
Was a[F]live as [F#dim7]he could [C]be,
And the [F]children [F#dim7]say he could [C]laugh
And [A]play just the [Dm]same as [G]you and [C]me.

[C]Frosty the snowman
knew the [F]sun was [F#dim7]hot that [C]day,
so he [F]said "Let's [F#dim7]run and we'll [C]have some [A]fun
now be[Dm]fore I [G]melt a[C]way.  [G7]

[C]Down to the village
with a [F]brromstick [F#dim7]in his [C] hand,
running here [F] and [F#dim7] there all a[C]round the [A]square
sayin' [Dm]"Catch me [G]if you [C]can."  [C7]

He [F]led them [F#dim7]down the [C]streets of [A7]town
right [Dm]to the [G7]traffic [C]cop,
and he [G]only paused a moment [G#dim7]when
he [Am]heard him [D6]holler, [G]"Stop!" [G7]

[C]Frosty the snowman had to [F]hurry [F#dim7]on his [C]way,
but he [F]waved good[F#dim7]bye sayin'
[C]"Don't you [A]cry, I'll be [Dm]back a[G]gain some [C]day."

[C]Thumpety, thump, thump,
thumpety, thump, thump, look at Frosty [G]go.
Thumpety, thump, thump,
thumpety, thump, thump, over the [G7]hills of [C]snow.
