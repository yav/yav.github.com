Just hear those [F]sleigh bells [Dm7]jingling,
[Gm7]ring, ting, [C]tingling [F]too. [Dm7] [Gm7]
Come on, [C]it's [F]lovely [Dm7]weather for a
[Gm7]sleigh ride to[C]gatherer with [F]you. [Dm7] [Gm7]

Out[C]side the [F]snow is [Dm7]falling and
[Gm7]friends are [C]calling "Yoo [F]hoo." [Dm7] [Gm7]
Come on, [C]it's [F]lovely [Dm7]weather for a
[Gm7]sleigh ride to[C]gather with [F]you.

Giddy[Bm7]yap, giddyyap, giddyyap, let's [E7]go,
[A] let's look at the [A6]snow.
[Bm7]  We're riding in a winder[E7]wand of [A]snow.
Giddy[Am7]yap, giddyap, giddyap, it's [D7]grand
[Gmaj7] just holding your [G6]hand.
[C7] We're gliding along
with a song of a
winter fairy land.

Our cheeks are [F]nice and [Dm7]rosy and
[Gm7]comfy, [C]cozy are [F]we [Dm7] [Gm7]
We've [C]snuggled [F]close to[Dm7]gather like two
[Gm7]birds of a [C]feather would [F]be. [Dm7] [Gm7]

Let's [C]take that [F]road be[Dm7]fore us and
[Gm7]sing a [C]chorus or [F]two. [Dm7] [Gm7]
Come [C]on, it's [F]lovely [Dm7]weather for a
[Gm7]sleigh ride to[C]gather with [F]you.

There's a [F]birthday party at the home of farmer [Fmaj7]Gray.
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect [F6]day.
We'll be [F#dim7]singing the songs
we [Gm7]love to [G#dim7]sing
with[Am7]out a [A7]single [Dm7]stop [Bm7b5]
at the [E7]fireplace where
we'll [Bm7]watch the [E7]chestnuts [A]pop.
[C7]Pop, pop, pop!

There's a [F]happy feeling nothing in the world can [Fmaj7]buy
when they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin [F6]pie.
It'll [F#dim7]nearly be like
a [Gm7]picture [G#dim7]print by
[Am7]Curri[A7]er and [Dm7]Ives. [G7]
[C7]  These wonderful
things are the things
we remember all through our lives.

Just hear those [F]sleigh bells [Dm7]jingling,
[Gm7]ring, ting, [C]tingling [F]too. [Dm7] [Gm7]
Come on, [C]it's [F]lovely [Dm7]weather for a
