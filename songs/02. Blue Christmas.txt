I'll have a [G]blue Christmas with[D]out you.
I'll be so [D7]blue just thinking a[G]bout you.
Decorations of [G7]red, on a [C]green Christmas tree,
[A7]won't be the same, dear, if [D]you're not here with [D7]me.

And when the [G]blue snow flakes start [D]fallin',
that's when those [D7]blue mem'ries start [G]callin',

You'll be doin' all [G7]right
with your [C6]Christmas of [C#dim7]white,
but [D]I'll have a [D7]blue, blue, blue, blue [G]Christmas.

(instrumental)
[G](2 bars)  [D](2 bars)

You'll be doin' all [G7]right
with your [C6]Christmas of [C#dim7]white,
but [D]I'll have a [D7]blue, blue, blue, blue
[G]Christ[G/B]mas [C] [C#dim7] [D7] [Ab7] [G7].
