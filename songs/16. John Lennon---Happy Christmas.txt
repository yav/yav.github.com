So this is [A]Christmas
And what have you [Bm]done
Another year [E]over
And a new one just [A]begun
And so this is [D]Christmas
I hope you have [Em]fun
The near and the [A]dear one
The old and the [D]young

A very Merry [G]Christmas
And a happy new [A]year
Let's hope it's a [Em]good one [G]
Without any [D]fear [E]

And so this is [A]Christmas
For weak and for [Bm]strong
For rich and the [E]poor ones
The world is so [A]wrong
And so happy [D]Christmas
For black and for [Em]white
For yellow and [A]red ones
Let's stop all the [D]fight

A very Merry [G]Christmas
And a happy new [A]year
Let's hope it's a [Em]good one [G]
Without any [D]fear [E]

And so this is [A]Christmas
And what have we [Bm]done
Another year [E]over
A new one just [A]begun
And so happy [D]Christmas
We hope you have [Em]fun
The near and the [A]dear one
The old and the [D]young

A very Merry [G]Christmas
And a happy new [A]year
Let's hope it's a [Em]good one
Without any [D]fear [E]

[A]War is over, [Bm]if you want it
[E]War is over [A]now

Happy Christmas!
