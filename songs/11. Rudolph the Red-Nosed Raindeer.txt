You kow [Dm7]Dasher and [Em]Dancer and [G7sus2]Prancer and [C]Vixen,
[Dm7]Commet and [Em]Cupid and [G7sus2]Doner and [C]Blitzen,
[Am]but do you [Am7]re[D7]call,
the most [Am7]famouse [D7]reindeer of [G7]all?

[C]Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
had a very shin[Ebdim7]y [G7]nose,
and if you ever saw it
you would even [Gaug]say it [C]glows.

All of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call [Ebdim7]him [G7]names.
They never let poor Rudolph
join in any reindeer [C]games. [C7]

[F]Then one foggy [C]Christmas Eve,
[Dm]Santa [G7]came to [C]say,
[G]"Rudolph, with your nose so [G#dim7]bright,
[Am]won't you [D13]guide my [G7]sleigh tonight?"

[C]Then how the reindeer loved him,
as they shouted out [Ebdim7]with [G7]glee:
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
you'll go down in histo[C]ry!"  [C7]
