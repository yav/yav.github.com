<h1>Haskell Code in LaTeX</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>.
There are two ways to add code to a literate Haskell script.
</p>

<p>The first method is to prefix code lines with a greater-then sign (&gt;).
Here is an example:
<pre>
This text is a literate comment.
This is an example program that prints the 11th Fibonacci number:

> main = print (fibs !! 10)
>  where fibs = 0 : 1 : [ x + y | (x,y) <- zip fibs (tail fibs) ]

This is also a comment.  When we use this style of literate programming,
we have to separate code and comments with a blank line.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
For me, the above is the preferred way of writing literate code.
However, Haskell supports another way of adding code to literate scripts
which was specifically added to support embedding Haskell code in
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> documents.
This is useful in situations when we want to make sure that the code in
an academic article is well-formed.  We can write the article as a literate
Haskell script, and then use a Haskell implementation (e.g., <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc">GHC</a>)
to validate the code.   In this style, text that belongs to the LaTeX
environment <tt>code</tt> is considered to be Haskell code.
Here is the above example written in this style:
<pre>
This text is a literate comment.
This is an example program that prints the 11th Fibonacci number:
\begin{code}
main = print (fibs !! 10)
  where fibs = 0 : 1 : [ x + y | (x,y) <- zip fibs (tail fibs) ]
\end{code}
This is also a comment.  When we use this style of literate programming,
we do not need to separate the text and the code blank lines.
</pre>
</p>

Note that <tt>code</tt> is not a predefined LaTeX environment.
It needs to be defined by the LaTeX user to specify how to layout code.
One way to do this is to use the <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/468496.html">fancyvrb</a> LaTeX package.
This package makes it easy to specify various formatting options for verbatim text.
To define <tt>code</tt> with the <tt>fancyvrb</tt> package simply add the following to
the top (preamble) of you LaTeX article:
<pre>
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{code}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\small}
\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{example}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\small}
\newcommand{\ignore}[1]{}
</pre>
The first line specifies that we are using fancyvrb, the second defines the
<tt>code</tt> environment, and the third line defines another environment (not strictly necessary)
which can be used for text that should be formatted as code but should not be checked
by the compiler (e.g., sample output).  The parameters to the environment definitions
specify that we are using the <tt>Verbatim</tt> environment (fancyvrb provides
other environments too), and that we would like code to be typeset with a small font
(there are other options that can be specified here, see the fancyvrb documentation).
The fourth line is also not strictly necessary but it is useful to remove code
that does not belong to the paper but is still necessary for the rest of the implementation
to work.  Here is an example of how to use these macros:
<pre>
Some ordinary text.
\begin{code}
-- This is visible in the paper and to the Haskell implementation.
\end{code}
\begin{example}
This is visible in the paper but it is ignored by Haskell.
Still, it is typeset as code.
\end{example}
\ignore{
\begin{code}
-- This is not visible in the paper but is visible to Haskell
\end{code}
}
</pre>
